## Gap Analysis

### Completed ✅
1. All core capture and search functionality
2. Privacy and consent systems
3. Explainability via receipts
4. Testing infrastructure
5. Resilience mechanisms
6. Performance optimizations

### Minor Gaps (P2) ⚠️
1. **Voice capture (UC-2)**: STT adapter stubbed but not integrated
   - Mitigation: Text capture fully functional
2. **Biometric gates**: Deferred to V2 per PRD
   - Mitigation: Not required for V1
3. **Mobile apps**: Out of scope for V1
   - Mitigation: Desktop-first as designed

### No Critical Gaps ✅
All P0 requirements are implemented and tested.

## Appendix: Traceability

### File-to-Requirement Mapping
```
daemon/capture.py         → UC-1, Capture friction → zero
daemon/search.py          → UC-3, Context < 500ms
daemon/algorithms.py      → Decisions with receipts
daemon/consent.py         → Privacy & consent
daemon/synthesis_worker.py → UC-5, Daily synthesis
daemon/indexers/fts.py    → FTS search requirement
daemon/indexers/vector.py → Vector search requirement
tests/test_algorithms.py  → Algorithm validation
tests/integration/*       → E2E validation
scripts/chaos_inject.py   → Resilience testing
```

### Metric Definitions
- **Capture p99**: 99th percentile latency from API call to WAL flush
- **Search p50**: 50th percentile latency to first useful result
- **Utility threshold**: 0.55 minimum score for "useful" classification
- **Memory target**: <1.5GB RSS under normal operation
